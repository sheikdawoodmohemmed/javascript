<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create document on the World Wide Web. It is simply a collection of certain key words called ‘Tags’ that are helpful in writing the document to be displayed using a browser on Internet.
<br>    It is a platform independent language that can be used on any platform such as Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and so on. To display a document in web it is essential to mark-up the different  e l eme n t s   ( h e a d i n g s ,   p a r a g r a p h s ,   t a b l e s ,   a n d   s o   o n )   o f   t h e document with the HTML tags. To view a mark-up document u s e r   h a s   t o   o p e n   t h e   d o c u m e n t   i n   a   b r o w s e r .   A   b r o w s e r understands and interpret the HTML tags, identifies the structure of the document (which part are which) and makes decision about presentation (how the parts look) of the document.
<br>			HTML also provides tags to make the document look attractive using graphics, font size and colors. User can make a link to the other document or the different section of the same document by creating Hypertext Links also known as Hyperlinks
